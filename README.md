# Deliveroo API

Deliveroo API is the API to make my [Deliveroo web app](https://thirsty-lamarr-1b3108.netlify.app/) work. This API simply allows users to get all the menus of the restaurant *Le Pain Quotidien*.

Note that data is stored as a simple `json` file which is returned to the frontend.

Frontend project is here: ðŸ‘‰ [Frontend](https://github.com/Remi-deronzier/deliveroo-frontend)
